Person
  - maybe 50/50 random choice if certain level of randomness


Reward choices
  - if picking wrong, each step isn't equal and probability matching, interim state allows one to wait before moving
  - "waiting until the lightbulb turns on before acting" -- is it maximizing EV by going to middle, if it does?
  - relative values of pickign wrong, picking right, and waiting





sequences:
- G of 1 but transitions change

- discussion points
  - potentially making ABCD automated and only interim useful --> limitations/benefits
  - something a rat might do
  - evolution / reinforcement learning
  - positive reinforcement in nature possible? otherwise seems like penalized for bad actions





  Learning:
  - first need to know something is different/has changed
  - pos and negative both assumes the space is completely closed - why Bayes is compelling but
